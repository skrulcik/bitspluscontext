## Where is Apple's big AR project?

For years, it has felt like AR and VR technology are right on the cusp of taking off. Every time Apple has a launch event I hope that this year is the year we get the next Big One from Apple. The product that defines a new generation of consumer electronics. The product that finally pushes VR over the last few hurdles and into the everyday consumers hand.

I think that AR seems like a better option for consumer products, because it can be with us all the time, while 

### Why AR?

Virtual reality is the most complete experience. With virtual reality, we can imagine dystopian futures of inert humans, experiencing their entire life through virtual reality. Virtual sensations of taste, serenity, chaos and awe even beyond the most enthralling that the real world has to offer. As the intensity of experiences increases, their value will decrease.

This timing, along with what I consider to be underwhelming hype from Apple itself, made the "EarPod" replacement storyline the easiest to follow. As far as I can tell, consumers treat airpods like headphones. They're not.

### The Lesser Wearable

The hooplah around the Apple Watch was that it was Apple's first foray into the "wearable."

What makes a good wearable? As a young guy (i.e. part of the 50% of the population with reasonably sized pockets), I carry my phone with me constantly. I come as close to "wearing" that rectangle as one possibly can _footnote: without a belt clip, link to Dwight_.
