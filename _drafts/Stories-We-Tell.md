## Kinds of Stories

I'll define stories as a description of events that has some purpose, or point to it. The sequence of events should be consistent (a character can't die in one event, then take part in one that happens after[^0])

### Raw Stories

Some stories are exist purely to be a good 

### Teaching Stories

- Explaining morals of a culture, Gilgamesh, the Bible
- Teaching gullible children, Cheinoos

## Tricky Stories

## Rationalization

Stories we tell ourselves can be the hardest to detect. It is easy for us to unconsciously accept the simplest story that explains events.

## Personal Narratives

These are the meta-stories that spin-off countless minor variations. My favorite is the Entrepreneur Memoir:

1. Alice had a great idea
2. "Common Sense Charlie" told Alice that she would fail
3. Alice was bold, and broke the rules, leading directly to her success[^4]
4. Charlie looks so dumb now!
5. Now when someone tells YOU your idea is not good, ignore them! They're just as dumb as Common Sense Charlie.

This is wrong on so many levels,[^3] but the story is repeated over and over again. Whenever someone describes the way that a company started

## The Power of Stories

- Simple
- Easy to Understand
- Emotionally Evocative (The Things They Carried)

Stories simplify. Stories are simpler than experience, and are designed to be easy to digest. It's impossible to accurately convey the details of every event. Even when we tell stories from our point of view, we can't remember as vividly as we can experience. A lot of that detail isn't important, though. When we tell a story we pick out the important parts, and, like editing a move, trim, expand, and enhance each scene into a more engaging narrative. We want other people to enjoy our stories, or at least feel some emotional reaction to them.

"Emotionally evocative" is a necessary requirement of all stories. 

### True War Stories

One of the most provocative articles I've read about stories[^1] is by Tim O'Brien. It has appeared as a standalone article "How to Tell a True War Story" and as a chapter in The Things They Carried. In it, Tim tries to describe what it means to tell the truth. What I got out of it is that he was trying to convey an emotional truth; to induce empathy. War is a beast whose scale and intensity is incomprehensible to outsiders. How can a story about war be understood, when the context of story is cannot be. The most true way to represent a war story may not be to present the events as they appear in a captain's log, but as they appear through the eye of the combatant, as they are remembered. A story, like a memory, is irrecoverably distorted[^2].

### Side Note on Powerful Rhetoric

Stories, like any form of convincing rhetoric, can cut multiple ways. The value of a story, or its truth, are independent of its power. Both real and fictional stories can be captivating, and there can be many more fictional stories than real ones.

I want to make a long, well-thought-out post about this topic. For now, I'll say that I used to get caught up thinking "but it shouldn't be that way!" Now, I try to accept that truthiness and rhetorical power are not naturally connected. If I accept that as immutable, it becomes my responsibility to use rhetoric effectively to spread the truth. Rhetoric becomes even more important, because if I ignore it, I can spew forth as much truth as I want, but it will never take root.

The fact that humans are so easily swayed by stories is not a _bad thing_. It's just a _thing_. If we understand the power of stories, we can identify when it is being used to spread hate and slander, and promote its use to spread goodness and knowledge. Only by understanding how stories captivate and

[^0] Unless it's Berrick Dondarian?
[^1] It might be the only article I've ever read that discusses stories directly. But still, it's really good!
[^2] I'm tempted to make a non-sequitor to information theory here. Once the bits are lost, there isn't a way to get them back.
[^3] Oh you _know_ a blog post/rant about this specific story is coming in the near future. Working title "Entrepreneurship Is a Circle Jerk"
[^4] Okay she failed a bit, but she failed _fast_ so it doesn't count. That was on purpose. It's definitely a different type of failure than what Common Sense Charlie was saying...right?
