The name of this blog comes from the title of the first section of my
introduction to computer systems textbook ([CS:APP](http://csapp.cs.cmu.edu/)).
The statement is literally true in computer systems -- but it is a metaphor for
what I want to write about, too.

I write about computer science, technology and cybersecurity. The bits.  But
I don't want to ignore how they affect the world, and how the world affects
them. The context. This blog is about both the code we write, and the world we
write it in.
